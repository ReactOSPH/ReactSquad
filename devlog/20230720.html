      <p>
        It's been a while since we updated our website to make it more appealing to the users, so here's a major
        update on what we're working on.
      </p>
      <h2>The design overhaul</h2>
      <p>
        While initially planning for the redesign to say goodbye to the <code>1.0 Initial Release</code> look
        (we'll call it <code>1.1 "Redesign"</code>), I was planning on craving the design to suit the themes,
        hence, I chose the dynamic route where I implement both light and dark modes. Pictured here is what
        they used to look like in three versions up to the current state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="centerImage" src="../media/devlog/20230720/what_has_changed.png" alt="">
      </p>
      <p>
        I somehow forgot to update the site after a long time (even though I said I had to) due to my busy days
        at VTubing -- well, who would've known that a co-founder of a project aiming to introduce ReactOS is a
        VTuber -- but behind-the-scenes, I was trying many ways to improve the site. Through various efforts and
        attempts at improving the design from the other ones (most notably #MamaNyoSquad's Venus Island Diaries),
        I was finally able to implement them to the site!
      </p>
      <p>
        This list may be updated and detailed in a future DevLog:
        <ul>
          <li>Introduced the splash screen on all pages</li>
          <li>Implemented <code>background-clip</code> to distinguish PH and IT text elements</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Blog post in DevLogs</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the blog posts are carried over here as part of the design overhaul! Which means that it'll be a
        'unified' experience with testings, updates and other shenanigans in context of ReactOS and ReactSquad.
      </p>
      <h2>Neocities + GitHub</h2>
      <p>
        As a part of the redesign plans, I've recently set up a GitHub Organization to take care of its individual
        repository, as well as when we can provide commits to ReactOS in the future. With this, I've researched a
        number of ways to integrate it to Neocities for a seamless publish. You can take a look at the
        <a class="urlHead" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="../.github/workflows/publish_to_neocities.yml">YML</a>
        for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="centerImage" src="../media/devlog/20230720/neocities_github.png" alt="">
      </p>
      <p>
        I've recently backed up the previous repo before I can publish it straight from GitHub because I want to
        remove the previous instances and everything before moving forward with the commit.
      </p>
      <h2>Future plans</h2>
      <p>
        Below are the future implementations that I might consider before setting it for a full release:
        <ul>
          <li>ReactOS on the News</li>
          <li>ReactSquad about page</li>
          <li>Twitter live feed (still deciding because of recent API changes, thanks Elon)</li>
          <li>Light mode</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thanks for reading through this blog! It's been two days since I worked on it, so I'm excited to share more
        updates as times go by! Of course, more testing with ReactOS as we look forward to the debut of ReactSquad
        2.0!
