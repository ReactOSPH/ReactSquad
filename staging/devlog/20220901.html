      <p>
        Following the near-end of the year and our upcoming first anniversary, we have evolved so much in presenting
        what's happening in the ReactOS Family of Communities! And following our launch of the website, we kept finding
        ways to connect to people and experience the open-source alternative to Windows. <b>So with that, we've finally
        decided to relaunch the website slowly!</b>
      </p>
      <h2>So, what's the deal?</h2>
      <p>
        We're constantly evolving! So with this, we're aiming to split our key areas into sections that will be easy for
        everyone, regardless of which locale. Most of the key areas are still existing, but there will be slow
        improvements! We'll let you know via our socials, chats or another DevLog for details.
      </p>
      <h2>ReactOS Italia</h2>
      <p>
        We've recently managed to acquire ReactOS Italia's
        <a class="urlHead" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/reactositalia" target="_blank">Twitter Account</a>
        from the previous management with the intention of continuing its reach towards the Italian Community! As such,
        with it being a part of ReactSquad, we've integrated it into our website, which has a separate page! If you've
        been in our homepage defaulted at ReactOS-PH, click the <strong><span class="rosIT">IT</span></strong> link to
        visit the landing page for the Italian Division.
      </p>
      <h2>Any more to come?</h2>
      <p>
        Right now we're in the process of consolidating every piece that we have missed during the development, including
        the recent ReactOS Tests! Once we're done, we'll keep you updated on the future roadmap.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thank you for your undying support for ReactSquad, and we remain committed to providing more to the table that
        unifies the experience of all the communities with our main goal: To introduce ReactOS, an open-source alternative
        to Windows!
