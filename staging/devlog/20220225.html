      <p>
        It is definitely a saddening moment in history as we have witnessed the sudden invasion of the so-called Russian
        Federation in Ukraine. The sudden invasion has caused a major upset and has inflicted thousands, if not millions,
        of damages to lives and properties. They do not deserve these difficulties and we have their sympathies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have learned that these activities are caused by Russia's recklessness and indecisive actions that has extended
        beyond reach. Citing from President Obama, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that we have witnessed the
        forces of division and autoritarianism make headway around the globe, mounting an assault on the ideals of democracy,
        rule of law, equality, individual liberty, freedom of expression and worship, and self-determination; and that the
        invasion determined where these dangerous trends can leadâ€”and why they CANNOT be left unchallenged.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are calling the Members of the United Nations and related organizations to take immediate measures to protect the
        people and impose sanctions against the attackers immediately. To the Biden-led United States of America, please
        uphold your stand against the invasion and take necessary actions to prevent it from affecting neighboring countries
        across Europe and beyond.
      </p>
      <p><strong>
        In addition, we are calling the Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin to withdraw his indecisive and reckless
        action to attack the precious country of Ukraine, and by any means suppressing the babbling threat of 'mutitudes of
        consequences upon interviening with his and the country's affairs', for the greater good of mankind.
      </strong></p>
      <p>
        We will continue to uphold our extent of support to the Ukrainian people and monitor the situation as it unfolds to
        the rest of the globe.
